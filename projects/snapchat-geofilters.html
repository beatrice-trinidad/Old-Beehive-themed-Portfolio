                <h1 class="title">Snapchat Geofilters</h1>

                <h2 class="projectdesc">A few years ago, Snapchat Geofilters used to only be available in certain locations and cities. When my hometown was lacking one, I decided to take action and create one. Now, Geofilters have become a massive way to promote your event, location, brand, or business.</h2>

                <h1 class="section-title">My First Community Geofilter</h1>

                <p>In 2015, <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/create/submit.html?utm_source=snapchat&utm_medium=site&utm_campaign=community_section#type" target="blank">Snapchat Community Geofilters</a> were gaining traction. At first, they were only available in major cities, but eventually became more widespread. I was a senior in high school and 17 years old then, and Snapchat was incredibly popular with my peers. I remember us thinking that Snapchat Geofilters were the coolest thing to include in your snapchat, especially if you went to somewhere like New York City. However, I heard a lot of complaints among my peers about why my hometown, Sayreville, didn't have one whereas other nearby towns did. I thought the same thing myself, so I decided to look into it. Was there some sort of application you had to fill to get one for your area? Did Snapchat make the geofilters for you?</p>
                
                <p>It turned out that to submit a Community Geofilter, it was totally voluntary for anyone to submit one for a public place. At the time, the instructions were a very vague processs - just follow the dimensions and size they asked for, and wait for their approval.</p>
                
                <img class="center-img-small" src='/img/snapchat-geofilters/sayrevillegeofilter01-01.png'>
                
                <p>I really wanted to show some Sayreville pride, so I incorporated our school's colors of Blue and Gray, along with our secondary colors of White and Black. In addition, I wanted to include a bomber aircraft since our team name is the Sayreville Bombers.</p>
                
                <h2 class="center">Submission approved!</h2>
                
                <img class="center-img" src='/img/snapchat-geofilters/sayrevillegeofilter01-email01.png'>
                
                <p>After waiting four days after submission, it was approved! My design was available throughout the town. My friends and peers were ecstatic about it to the point where people were thanking me for making one. To this day, it is still crazy to me that the Geofilter is still used. I realized that this Geofilter has not only made an impact on people who live in this small town in New Jersey, but on people who are simply passing by as well.</p>
                
                
                <h1 class="section-title">My Second Community Geofilter</h1>
                
                <img class="center-img-small" src='/img/snapchat-geofilters/sayrevillegeofilter02-01.png'>
                
                <p>In 2016, one year after my first one, I decided to make another Geofilter for my hometown. This time, I wanted to make it a lot more simpler and let people know where exactly my small town is.</p>
                
                <img class="center-img" src='/img/snapchat-geofilters/sayrevillegeofilter02-metrics.png'>
                
                   
                <p>This time around, Snapchat was able to provide metrics for this Geofilter. As of March 2018, it is so incredibly humbling to see how many people have encountered my snapchat geofilter so far - and the amount of exposure can only increase from here!</p>
                
                <h1 class="section-title">...And More Geofilters To Come</h1>
                
                <p>Since then, I have created several personal Geofilters, especially for the events and birthdays of my friends. When I created a Snapchat Geofilter for my 21st birthday, it ended up getting 15,600+ views and was used 149 times that night! Creating Snapchat Geofilters will always be fun projects for me, and I hope to create more in the future. </p>
