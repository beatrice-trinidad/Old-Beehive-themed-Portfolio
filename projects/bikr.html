                <p>Be able to the explore the world on a budget with <b>bikr</b>, a bike-sharing app that allows you to to choose a bike that fits your style, location, and price with one tap. </p>
            
                <p>For my Project Management class, we had a whole semester to work on a project to present at the <a href="https://itishowcase.rutgers.edu" target="blank">ITI Showcase</a> for the Information Technology & Informatics program at Rutgers University. I was placed with five other team members, and we were given the topic of supporting the gig economy. Thus, our mobile app, bikr, was born. Throughout the semester, we had to practice our elevator pitch, work on an app prototype, and provide market research & project financials. </p> 
            
                <p>For this project, I had the role of Project Manager/Team Leader. I was in charge of making sure that all tasks were done on time and that everyone was pulling their own weight. I really enjoyed having this responsibility because I was able to be involved in all aspects of the product, from presentation, planning, to prototyping. Despite my leadership position, I heavily worked with the team member in charge of design & development to put together the prototype. For prototyping, we designed the bikr app with <a href="https://www.infragistics.com/products/indigo-studio" target="blank">Indigo Studio</a> at the recommendation of the ITI department. Supplement designs, such as our bikr logo, were created in Adobe Photoshop.</p>
            
                <p>It's simple: bike owners put up their bikes for rent and then Bikr users can find their bike of choice at anytime, anywhere. Compared to privately owned bike sharing systems in major cities, people can have access to all different kinds of bikes in the pool within their price range. Whether you want to rent a mountain bike for the weekend or see the city in a new way, bikr provides a simple platform to connect and welcome anyone in the community.</p>
