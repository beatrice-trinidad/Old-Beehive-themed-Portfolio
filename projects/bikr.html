                <p><b>Users:</b> In the broadest sense, people that want a simple biking experience and bike owners that want flexibility & to make more money than they would otherwise - read below for more details and further demographics</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">Background</h1>
                <p>For my <a href="https://comminfo.rutgers.edu/academics/courses/27#course-1175" target="_blank">Management of Technological Organizations</a> class, we had a whole semester to work on a mobile app idea to present at the <a href="https://dev-iti-show.pantheonsite.io/" target="_blank">ITI Showcase</a> for the Information Technology & Informatics program at Rutgers University. I was placed with five other team members, and we were given the topic of supporting the gig economy. Thus, our mobile app, bikr, was born. Throughout the semester, we had to practice our elevator pitch, work on an app prototype, and provide market research & project financials. </p>
            
                <p>For this project, I was originally assigned the role of Design & Development. However, at a certain point, my team unofficially named me to also take on the role of Team Leader because I was so passionate about this project. I really enjoyed having this responsibility because I was able to be involved in all aspects of the product, from presentation, planning, to prototyping. Despite my leadership, I heavily worked with the team member in charge of design & development to put together the prototype and brand design. Although I took on "Team Leader", I can honestly say that this is the best team I have ever worked on for an academic project and I truly think they all showed leadership in their own ways. </p>
                
                <h1 class="section-title">Join the Bikr Gang</h1>
                
                    <p>The main point that my team connected to was that we all loved to travel and explore cities. However, we realized that in several major cities, you're limited to major bicycle sharing systems such as CitiBike or Indego. Of course, there are a few bike rental shops, but we figured that those shops can be difficult to reach due to lack of transportation and availability; you never know if a city will have convenient bike rental shops near you. Personally, when I rode on Blue Bike in New Orleans, it was a huge hassle to to find the nearest bike dock station since my phone had died and because we were so far from the city center. Even more so, major bicycle sharing systems are all so standard and - as my teammate stated - <i>ugly.</i> </p>
                
                    <p>Thus, we had the idea of an app that would make allows you to have the power to choose a bike that fits your style and convenience at the best price for you. It's simple: bike owners put up their bikes for rent and then bikr users can find their bike of choice at anytime, anywhere. Compared to privately owned bike sharing systems in major cities, people can have access to all different kinds of bikes in the pool within their price range. bikr provides a simple platform to connect and welcome anyone in the community in just a few steps: </p>
            
    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Everyday to every occasion: Choose or list any bike, whether it be a mountain bike for the weekend or to explore in a new way</li>
                        <li>Agree on a bike booking </li>
                        <li>Exchange bikes and go!</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <p>One of our top priorities was to create a platform for our users to consume less while gaining more. Our tracking technology, rating system, and theft & protection program will ensure that everyone in the bikr community can enjoy their journey on trust. We're different in that the amount of bikes adjusts to the market, no need for bike docks, bikes come in a wide variety and selection, and because bikes would be available in several geographical locations. Virtually anyone with our mobile app can participate. We believe with bikr, the ride to a better future starts here. You can leave concerns behind and focus instead on where you’re going and the memories you're making while using bikr. </p>
            
                    <h2 class="projectdesc">Life is a beautiful ride. Enjoy it!</h2>
            
            
            <h1 class="section-title">Branding & Design</h1>
            
            <p>Our main goal was to come off as fun, friendly, and simple as possible. I was lucky enough to have a team with a good eye, so we decided on vibrant colors along with a minimal font. Because we wanted to encourage a better environment through biking, we decided to go with green as our main color to tie in with this theme. We mostly stuck with green, white, and black, but there were a few other bold colors we included in our presentation slides.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Research</h1>
            
                <p>As the semesester progressed, we were to include more and more research behind our idea and present them. By the final stage, we had to prepare several components, including the solution flow diagram, stakeholders, customers, scope, market research, SWOT analysis, magic quadrant, ethics, project financials (summary income statement, 5-year gross net-benefit), and lessons learned. All in all, because I don’t have that much experience when it comes to the aspect of business, I learned a lot about what to consider when it comes to a product due to this research. Here are a some highlight slides we came up with at presentation:</p>
            
                
                <div class="row">

                    <div class="column"><img class="center-img" src="/img/bikr/swotanalysis02.png"></div>

            <h1 class="section-title">App Prototype</h1>
            
            <p>We were given a short amount of time to come up with a an app prototype, so we could not go into as much research about UI and UX design as much as I would have liked. Nonetheless, we quickly took on inspiration from apps like AirBNB and Uber for thier design and functionality. While implementing the brand design we came up with, we designed the bikr app with <a href="https://www.infragistics.com/products/indigo-studio" target="blank">Indigo Studio</a> at the recommendation of the ITI department. Supplement designs, such as our bikr logo, were created in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.</p>
            
            <p><i>Due to time constraints, we were not able to make everything as functioning and clickable as we would have liked so please keep that in mind while checking out the prototype!</i></p>
            
            <a href="https://indigodesigned.com/share/run/mbmehzhgxj3g" target="blank">
            <div class="button">
            <i class="fas fa-mouse-pointer"></i> Check out the bikr app</div></a>
            
            
            <h1 class="section-title">Showcase</h1>
            
                <p>At the end of the semester, we competed against 35 other teams for the Judges and Student awards. We had five minutes to present our pitch and prototype to judges from a wide variety of academic, entrepreneurship, and IT-related organizations. We even made our own bikr shirts! It was a little nerve-wrecking, but great experience at this showcase. 
                    
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/bikr/showcase02.JPG">

                <p>Unfortunately, our bikr gang did not win any awards, but I felt like I won by having such a great team, as corny as that sounds. I was lucky enough to have been placed in a group in which we got all got along so well even though all of us were strangers to each other. This project was more fun than work, and we are so proud of how it came out. Of course we are a little disappointed that the judges did not see us fit to win the prize, we are still so happy to have met each other and created something awesome. </p>
            
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/bikr/showcase01.JPG">

                <p>Above all, I would like to thank <a href='https://comminfo.rutgers.edu/close-deborah' target=“blank”>Professor Close</a> for being one of the best professors I have ever had in my college career thus far. She taught our class so much academically and about the real world, and I was always excited to come to her class. She really believed in our team, and she had such great enthusiasm and support for our bikr gang. A huge thank you to her!</p> 

                <p>Our team is still in touch, and perhaps we will make bikr become a reality one day. 🚲</p>
