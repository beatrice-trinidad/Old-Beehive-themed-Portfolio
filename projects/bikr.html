                <h1 class="section-title">Background</h1>
                
                    <p>For my Project Management class, we had a whole semester to work on a project to present at the <a href="https://itishowcase.rutgers.edu" target="blank">ITI Showcase</a> for the Information Technology & Informatics program at Rutgers University. I was placed with five other team members, and we were assigned the topic of supporting the gig economy. Thus, our mobile app, bikr, was born. Throughout the semester, we had to practice our elevator pitch, work on an app prototype, and provide market research & project financials. This class called for us to create a technology-based solution in a real-world scenario. </p>
            
             <h1 class="section-title">Research</h1>
            
                <p>After the design was finalized, I was also given the task of actually coding the page. By working with the department's head Application Developer, this was my first exposure to working with Drupal, a content-management framework. Although I had experience with editing and managing Drupal content for <a href="http://ruonlinecon.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Rutgers Online Learning Conference</a>'s website, I had never implemented web development along with Drupal's platform. Prior to this, I had only some experience with WordPress and static websites so working with Drupal was a new challenge for me. HTML and CSS were nothing new to me, but learning how to work with blocks, regions, and views were definitely confusing at first. However, I eventually got the hang of it and was able to bring the mockups to life through code. </p>
            
            <h1 class="section-title">SHOWCASE</h1>
            
                <p>After I had completed design and development of this login page, my part was done in this side-project, and the Instructional Design team continued to make minor edits to evolve the design and functionality. 
                
                The login page went live on March 13, 2017 on the day of the <a href="http://ruonlinecon.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Rutgers Online Learning Conference</a>. The login page was an impressive achievement for me personally, considering that it was a complete redesign and rebuild from scratch. The redesign of the Canvas login page at Rutgers recieved positive reviews from students and faculty members alike, and the design still remains as the login page today.</p>
