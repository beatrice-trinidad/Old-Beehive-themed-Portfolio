                <h2 class="projectdesc">In 2017, three well-established, independent instructional technology units at Rutgers University joined together to become a new merger department called Teaching and Learning with Technology (TLT). I was in charge of developing a website that consolidated what was previously the¬†Office of Instructional & Research Technology, the¬†Center for Online & Hybrid Learning and Instructional Technologies, and¬†Rutgers Instructional Technology & eLearning Solutions.

                <p><b>Role:</b> Web Development (Team of 2)</p>

                <p><b>Client:</b> Rutgers University: Teaching and Learning with Technology (TLT), Division of Continuing Studies</p>

                <p><b>Tools:</b> Drupal, HTML, CSS, Git workflow</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">Insight & Challenges</h1>

                 <p>My supervisor and I were given the task of creating a website acted as a representative of three different instructional technology websites and a gateway to instructional technology resources. There are a lot of different visitors we had in mind to cater to, such as students, prospective students, faculty, and instructional designers of Rutgers University. While developing this website, we worked together to create something that was functional and resourceful.</p>

                <p>While working at TLT under my supervisor, this was probably one of the biggest learning experiences I have had. I have had prior experience to working with Drupal for <a href='http://ruonlinecon.rutgers.edu' target='blank'>Rutgers Online Learning Conference</a>‚Äôs website, but it was limited to editing and adding content. Additionally, I had some experience of implementing front-end code into the Drupal framework by working on the <a href='/projects/canvaslogin.html' target=‚Äúblank‚Äù>Canvas login page</a> for Rutgers University. However, this required much back-end work due to totally new theming and styles. During the process of development, I became incredibly familiar with Git workflow and how to use vim, a UNIX text editor program. Ultimately, the website‚Äôs appearance became much more sleek and modern compared to our <a href='http://onlinelearning.rutgers.edu' target='blank'>previous department</a>‚Äôs website.</p>

                <p>One challenge we had was the goal of making the website as accessible as possible. Because there are several site visitors with disabilities, we had to make many changes to design to make our website‚Äôs standards accessible for people with visual impairment or are in need of a screen reader. By working with <a href='http://oit.rutgers.edu/accessibility' target='blank'>Office of Information Technology</a>, we were able to review policies and use tools to accomplish the Rutgers IT Accessibility Initiative.</p>
