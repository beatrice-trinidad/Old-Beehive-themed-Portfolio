                <p>E NATURE is a Korean skincare brand created by one of the top cosmetic companies in South Korea, ITS HANBUL. Over the course of four months, I designed website assets and social media marketing campaigns for E NATURE as they made their debut in the US. I worked closely with the marketing and public relations team of Korean Beauty International to develop their brand in North America.</p>
            
                <p>With purely creative responsibilities, my experience was challenging yet fun. E NATURE is a skincare brand with a modern and simplistic aesthetic, so I really had to keep in mind that less is more when designing. The process of creating website buttons and other materials was a little hard for me at first since this was my first time designing for something that had a certain look to it. Previous to this opportunity, I had only done freelance graphic design work and I had a lot of flexibility in how I wanted the end result to look. However, during the process of working with E NATURE's marketing team, I truly learned how to translate what the brand is about into design. </p>
            
                <p>Interning with Korean Beauty International was rewarding for me, and I'm honored to have been a part of its very beginnings in the United States. I remember being so excited about seeing the website buttons I designed on E NATURE's website or seeing my marketing materials appear in online magazines. When I was an intern, E NATURE was only sold in America through their website, and the whole packing and shipping process was done by our small team at Korean Beauty International. Nowadays, it's crazy to me that E NATURE has expanded to major retailers like <a href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/brands/e-nature" target="blank">Urban Outfitters</a> and <a href="https://www.target.com/bp/e+nature" target="blank">Target</a> (which are some of my all-time favorite stores). I'm happy to see that Korean Beauty International and E NATURE have come a long way since I was an intern, and I'm sure they can only go up from here.</p>
