                <h1 class="section-title">Problem</h1>
                
                    <p>In 2017, Canvas had become a major learning management system at Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey. Previously, the majority of classes used Sakai or eCollege as educational platforms, but by this time, Canvas was becoming more widely used. Several migrations were being done from Sakai and eCollege to this platform as Canvas grew in popularity.</p>

                    <p>Although Canvas was favored for its clean and attractive design compared to the other learning management systems, the login page made by COHLIT at Rutgers... wasn't. In fact, the ‚Äúmain‚Äù page was actually divided into different pages. </p>
            
                <h2>Original Design</h2>
                
                    <img class="center-img" src="/img/canvas-login/oldcanvaslogin02.png">
                
                    <p>At this time, I was solely working as an Assistant Program Manager for the <a href='ruonlinecon2017.html'>Rutgers Online Learning Conference</a> hosted by TLT. However, because the Instructional Technology team saw my designing abilities, they asked me to be a part of this as a side-project from the conference. They also felt that it would be insightful and useful to have a current Rutgers student on the team as well since all of them have since graduated from college. Of course, I excitedly agreed to take on the challenge. </p>
                
                <h1 class="section-title">Empathize</h1>
                <h2>User Personas</h2>
                    
                    <p>As a student at Rutgers, it wasn't difficult for me to determine Canvas‚Äôs base users. By creating a few personas, I covered the hypothesized main groups of Canvas: faculty and students. However, I also realized that students could be broken into students who are more technologically inclined and those who are not. Typically, those who were less technologically inclined included older students going back for their Master‚Äôs or to complete another Bachelor‚Äôs degree.</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">Ideate & Prototype</h1>
                <h2>Low Fidelity Sketches & Prototypes</h2>
                    
                    <p>When I came into the project, the Instructional Technology team had already started to create some low fidelity sketches and prototypes as individuals. They each included what they felt like the login page for Canvas should look like, and it was interesting to see how they accomplished the task differently.</p>

                <h3 class="center">Sketch 3</h3>
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/canvas-login/sketch03.png">
                
                <h3 class="center">Lo-Fi Prototype 1</h3>
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/canvas-login/lofiprototype01.png">
                
                <h3 class="center">Lo-Fi Prototype 2</h3>

                    <p>Based on these drawings from six different people, I found some common design choices in each and integrated them into my own ideas of what would be the more simple and aesthetic experience . I also created a mobile and tablet sketch as well.</p>
            
                    <h1>!!!!! SKETCH HERE !!!!!</h1>
            
                <h2>Wireframing</h2>
                
                <h1>!!!!! WIREFRAMING HERE !!!!!</h1>
            
                <h2>Mockups</h2>
            
                <h1>!!!!! MOCKUPS HERE !!!!!</h1>
            
             <h1 class="section-title">Coding</h1>
            
                <p>After the design was finalized, I was also given the task of actually coding the page. By working with the department's head Application Developer, this was my first exposure to working with Drupal, a content-management framework. Although I had experience with editing and managing Drupal content for <a href="http://ruonlinecon.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Rutgers Online Learning Conference</a>'s website, I had never implemented web development along with Drupal's platform. Prior to this, I had only some experience with WordPress and static websites so working with Drupal was a new challenge for me. HTML and CSS were nothing new to me, but learning how to work with blocks, regions, and views were definitely confusing at first. However, I eventually got the hang of it and was able to bring the mockups to life through code. </p>
            
            <h1 class="section-title">Launch & Impact</h1>
            
                <p>After I had completed design and development of this login page, my part was done in this side-project, and the Instructional Design team continued to make minor edits to evolve the design and functionality. 
                
                The login page went live on March 13, 2017 on the day of the <a href="http://ruonlinecon.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Rutgers Online Learning Conference</a>. The login page was an impressive achievement for me personally, considering that it was a complete redesign and rebuild from scratch. The redesign of the Canvas login page at Rutgers recieved positive reviews from students and faculty members alike, and the design still remains as the login page today.</p>
