                <h1 class="section-title">Problem</h1>
                
                    <p>In 2017, Canvas had become a major learning management system at Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey. Previously, the majority of classes used Sakai or eCollege as educational platforms, but by this time, Canvas was becoming more widely used. Several migrations were being done from Sakai and eCollege to this platform as Canvas grew in popularity.</p>

                    <p>Although Canvas was favored for its clean and attractive design compared to the other learning management systems, the login page made by COHLIT at Rutgers... wasn't. In fact, the “main” page was actually divided into different pages. </p>
            
                <h2>Original Design</h2>
                
                    <img class="center-img" src="/img/canvas-login/oldcanvaslogin02.png">
                
                    <p>At this time, I was solely working as an Assistant Program Manager for the <a href='ruonlinecon2017.html'>Rutgers Online Learning Conference</a> hosted by TLT. However, because the Instructional Technology team saw my designing abilities, they asked me to be a part of this as a side-project from the conference. They also felt that it would be insightful and useful to have a current Rutgers student on the team as well since all of them have since graduated from college. Of course, I excitedly agreed to take on the challenge. </p>
                
                <h1 class="section-title">Empathize</h1>
                <h2>User Personas</h2>
                    
                    <p>As a student at Rutgers, it wasn't difficult for me to determine Canvas’s base users. By creating a few personas, I covered the hypothesized main groups of Canvas: faculty and students. However, I also realized that students could be broken into students who are more technologically inclined and those who are not. Typically, those who were less technologically inclined included older students going back for their Master’s or to complete another Bachelor’s degree.</p>

                <h2>Low Fidelity Sketches & Prototypes</h2>
                    
                    <p>When I came into the project, the Instructional Technology team had already started to create some low fidelity sketches and prototypes as individuals. They each included what they felt like the login page for Canvas should look like, and it was interesting to see how they accomplished the task differently.</p>

                    <p>Based on these drawings from six different people, I found some common design choices in each and integrated them into my own ideas of what would be the more simple and aesthetic experience . I also created a mobile and tablet sketch as well. After presenting this sketch to the instructional design team, they approved.</p>

                <h4 class="center">Mockup 1</h4>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                        <img class="center-img" src="/img/canvas-login/prototype01-01.png">
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <img class="center-img" src="/img/canvas-login/prototype01-02.png">

                </div>
                
                <p>After approval of my sketch, this was the first mockup I presented. I created two different views for sample tabs under News & Updates and Students. The reaction from the instructional design team was favorable, but there were some mixed feelings about a couple of things:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The image in the banner was distracting</li>
                    <li>The colors of the buttons were mediocre</li>
                    <li>There was too much detail going on, especially the gradient in the tabs</li>
                    <li>The page was missing a description for Canvas - it wasn't clear what this page is for</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h4 class="center">Mockup 2</h4>
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/canvas-login/prototype02-01.png">
            
                <p>With this one, I stripped the image and aimed for a flat and matte kind of feel. While creating this new look, I tried to limit the colors to red, gray, and blue. While researching how other universities made their own Canvas login pages, I was inpsired by the ones that were simple, geometric, and clean. Thus, I decided to create my own triangular background on Adobe Illustrator. It was appealing, but did not take away from the words or buttons. At the next meeting I presented this, the instructional design team liked it a lot, but there was still a few more edits they requested:</p>
            
                 <ul>
                    <li>They felt that there was too much red going on, especially because it conflicts with the standard banner above the navigation</li>
                    <li>Red seemed to be too much of an "alert" color</li>
                    <li>The buttons for the Google Play and Apple Store were not that obvious</li>
                    <li>The word "Canvas" is presented too small in the strip on the banner - is there a way to make it more obvious?</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h4 class="center">Mockup 3 - Final</h4>
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/canvas-login/prototype03-02.png">
                <p>This was the final mockup I presented. Color was the the biggest concern about the last design, so I tried to be conscious of what the best colors for each part of the design would be. I read up on some color theory and color psychology articles, and it really helped my choices for how I colored each part. According to a few articles about color and UI design, blue was the most favorable color in general globally, so I decided to implement much more blue. Additionally, I chose green for the buttons since it usually gives the feeling of "go" and stands out against the blue. This mockup ended up being approved unanimously by the instructional design team and was the final one to be created before web development.</p>
            
             <h1 class="section-title">Web Development</h1>
            
                <p>After the design was finalized, I was also given the task of actually coding the page. By working with the department's head application developer, this was my first exposure to working with Drupal, a content-management framework. Although I had experience with editing and managing Drupal content for <a href="http://ruonlinecon.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Rutgers Online Learning Conference</a>'s website, I had never implemented web development along with Drupal's platform. Prior to this, I had only some experience with WordPress and static websites so working with Drupal was a new challenge for me. HTML and CSS were nothing new to me, but learning how to work with blocks, regions, and views were definitely confusing at first. However, I eventually got the hang of it and was able to bring the mockups to life through code. </p>
            
            <h1 class="section-title">Launch & Impact</h1>
            
                <p>After I had completed design and development of this login page, my part was done in this side-project, and the Instructional Design team continued to make minor edits to evolve the design and functionality. For example, the current design implements more yellow to include all three primary colors in its view.</p>
                
                <p>The login page went live on March 13, 2017 on the day of the <a href="http://ruonlinecon.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Rutgers Online Learning Conference</a>. The login page was an achievement for me personally, considering that it was a complete redesign and rebuild from scratch. Besides developing this in a new environment, this was also my first true experience in a UI/UX process. The redesign of the Canvas login page at Rutgers recieved positive reviews from students and faculty members alike, and the design still remains as the login page today.</p>
