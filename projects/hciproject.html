                <h1 class="section-title">Stage 1: Problem Statement</h1>
            
                <h2 class="center">Context</h2>
            
                <p>Every morning, we start our day by peeking at our phones and being bombarded with a list of notifications to cater to. While our phone helps us access everything on the go, it's hard to focus our energy on one task at a time when in the back of our mind, we’re aware there’s several more tasks still to do. In spite of having several tools to solve all problems, we often find ourselves overwhelmed by the tools itself in addition to our lengthy to-do lists. Although we carry our phones with the intention of being more productive, the applications on it, in spite of being useful in an isolated environment, can arguably cause more harm when designed to compete for attention.</p>
            
                <h2 class="center">Problem</h2>
            
                <p>Smartphone addiction is as severe and widespread as other forms of addiction, except very few people realize that they have a problem, and even if they do, they choose to not address it. If someone does decide to address it, there's a lack of tools that help you systematically tackle the issue. The first step to curing addiction, is honestly admitting it and that comes through self awareness. From our data analysis, we know that the number of hours you use your phone does not relate to whether you're satisfied with your usage. Therefore tools that just simply help you track how many hours you use your phone, try to tackle a complex issue with a very simple, ordinary approach. Moreover, just like other forms of addiction, solving it requires individual pace and approach that suits their need and desire for solving it. However, current tools are based off of the premise that one size fits all. Overall, none present a solution that systematically, through a continuous step-by-step process, helps with smartphone addiction.</p>
                
                <h2 class="center">Why Is It Important?</h2>
            
                <p>According to data from Flurry Analytics, people in the US are spending more than five hours per day using their smartphones. In addition, the time spent using mobile apps increased 69% in a single year between 2015 to 2016. Clearly, the amount of time that people spend distracted by their smartphones is an alarming amount, and it’s only increasing, especially among the younger generation. As mentioned above, social scientists have even gone so far as to classify the problem as an “addiction.” This problem is seen on college campuses nationwide amongst students who lose countless hours to their phone when they should be working on important things which benefit them in their education, jobs, and other responsibilities. Human attention is the most valuable resource, and it should be spent on things which add up to a productive and healthy living. Wasting our attention is dangerous, not only for ourselves, but for future generations.</p>
            
                <h2 class="center">Why a Smartphone App?</h2>
                
                <p>Most, if not all, people that own a smartphone keep the device with them wherever they go. This is the ideal platform for our service to be accessed, since an individual’s levels of motivation are indifferent to the context in which they are present. The goals that people set for themselves are still there, waiting to be accomplished. Meaning that wherever a person may be, they can get back on track.</p>
            
                <p>A smartphone app also increases accessibility since it can be accessed offline. Individuals do not have to rely on an internet connection to get that push. This offline access is something that a website cannot offer. Even more so, a website cannot offer native notifications. With this feature, users can be quickly notified of valuable information pertaining to their progress in achieving their goals, as well as additional content to further develop the process of lowering reliance on motivation and increasing discipline.</p>
            
            
                <h1 class="section-title">Stage 2: Data Collection </h1>
            
                <h2 class="center">Interview Script</h2>
            
                <p>In this stage, we were to collect data from users so that we could understand user experience and information needs. </p>
            
                <p>To gather data, we did four semi-structured interviews. We started with set topics for discussion and followed up based on the answers. We made sure to formulate our questions to encourage rich, open-ended answers. Our interviewees were all fourth-year undergraduates: three males named James, Tazz, Roger, and one female named Micaela.</p>

                <h2 class="center">Survey</h2>
            
                <p>For the survey, we tried to make it so that we could get precise answers through enough questions to know about the users, their context, and the task. We included a variety of questions, from likert scale questions to open-ended questions. Although we were only required to get 10 responses, we ended up getting 100+ by the time this part was to be submitted! </p>

                <h2 class="center">Affinity Diagram</h2>
            
                <p>After our interviews, we transferred the raw data to sticky notes so that we could create an affinity diagram. To make sense of the interviews, we color-coordinated each interviewee and their thoughts. From there, we synthesized the notes by categorizing them into clusters that made sense to us.  To see a clear, digitalized version of our synthesized affinity diagram, <a href="https://ivanok.github.io/goldmoon/affinity-diagram.html" target="_blank">click here</a>. </p>

                <p>By the end of synthesis, we organized 140 sticky notes into the following categories:</p>
                <p>Current Restrictions, General Smartphone Use, Entertainment & Relaxation, Self-Image, Dead Phone Shows Reliance on Phone, Connecting to Outside World, Phone's Role in Connecting Relationships, Awareness of Use: Self Awareness of Self, Awareness of Use: Self Awareness of Others, Awareness of Use: Others Awareness of Self, Awareness of Use: Justification / Acceptance, Signs of Addiction, Signs of Addiction: Longest Time Away From Phone, Signs of Addiction: Less Sleep, Signs of Addiction: Frequency of Checking Phone, Cons of Texting, Face to Face Conversation, Work Apps, Convenience & Accessibility, Possible Solutions </p>

                <h3 class="center">What We Learned</h3>
                <p>Our interviews were very rich and in-depth which allowed us to explore motivations for smartphone usage beyond what appears on the surface. It was interesting to see how each of our interviewees were all somehow aware of excessive smartphone usage, but had different attitudes about it. One has taken many steps to hinder excessive smartphone usage; another just accepts it, sees it as the way things are, and doesn’t care; another is disciplined about his usage and is able to detach from his phone fairly easily; while yet another seems to focus more on the positives that he gets out of it, thus justifying his excessive usage. It was good and informative for us to see four different perspectives and to hear the many different answers to each of the questions. </p>
            
                <p>One big thing that we can draw from our interviews is the conclusion that students do use their smartphones excessively, and that smartphones act as distractions from being productive. The students also communicate a general sense of excessive smartphone usage negatively impacting their lives in areas such as mental or physical health, productivity level, or social pressure. We have noted that their constant reliance and apparent ‘need’ or preference for their smartphones ultimately shows signs of addiction (thus why we made this a super category with several sub-categories included within).</p>
            
                <p>Another super category that we formulated is Awareness of Use. Our interviewees displayed and shared about their different levels of self-awareness, awareness of others’ use, others’ awareness of their use, and a sense of justification or acceptance of their use. All of these things point to how students see and experience the phenomenon of excessive smartphone usage in their own lives and the world around them. Understanding our interviewees and their own awareness (how they see and react to the world) helps us step inside their shoes and look at the situation from a user perspective. Other categories such as current restrictions they use, or what they think would help them use their smartphones less excessively point to some potential solutions.</p>
            
                <p>Without delving in too deeply, we have found it interesting to observe the underlying motivations and ‘root issues’ responsible for this addiction. In reviewing our interviewees’ answers and expressions, we observe fears of loneliness or appearing ‘uncool’, a need to escape boredom or emptiness, apathy and mindless distraction, a desire for connection and relationships, and comparison combined with pressure to upkeep an ‘image’ of the self through social media. While there are, of course, positives to smartphones and how we use them, we observe many negatives which could be addressed. We would like to further explore these observations and see if we can formulate unique and creative solutions which are based on root causes, thus attacking the problem from the inside out.</p>
            
                <h2 class="center">Survey Results</h2>
            
                <p>At the time we were to hand in our survey results, we had a total of <b>115 responses</b> to look at.

If we filter out respondents who agree that they’ve found themselves using their phone longer than intended, 52.6% respondents feel unsatisfied with the amount of time spent on their phone. There is not a significant difference in level of satisfaction based on whether one feels that they use their phone longer than intended. Similarly, there is no difference in level of satisfaction based on whether you use productivity apps on your phone.</p>

                <p>Over 85% respondents believe that the smartphone negatively affects their life. While most feel that their productivity is affected, less than one-third respondents feel that their health is affected. What is interesting though, is that of all respondents who didn’t consider that their health was negatively affected, at least two-thirds have faced some sort of depression because of their usage habits and usually find themselves being anxious because of catering to notifications. Moreover, a strong 80% of respondents feel that their sleeping cycle is disturbed because of using their smartphone. As for distraction, more than half of the respondents find their phone most distracting in a public work setting like lecture halls and meetings.</p>

                <h3 class="center">What We Learned</h3>
                <p>When we compared the number of daily hours spent by a satisfied smartphone user with that of an unsatisfied one, the average usage is almost the same. This helps us understand that the amount of hours spent does not relate to whether you will be unsatisfied, but rather what you spend it on and how you look at excessive usage. In further comments, several respondents presented strong feelings about how smartphone addiction is growing and is harming them and society more than its helping, however, very few have actually looked into solving this problem systematically through a process or seeking aid from a friend or an app. In spite of admitting how it negatively affects their productivity, health and relationships, people seem to just have accepted that they’ll have to live with it, because not having a smartphone in this day and age, isn’t an option.</p>

                <h2 class="center">Personas</h2>
            
                <p>To better understand our potential users, we created personas so that we could get a precise description of a hypothetical user. For example, we could think about what they suffer from and wish to do when using a smartphone. Based on the problem, our own thinking, and inspired by survey results, we came up with Jessica and Michael.</p>
            
                 <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                         <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/Persona-%20Jessica%20Connor.png">

                <h2 class="center">Storyboard</h2>
                <p>Based on these personas, we created storyboards with these two personas so that we could visually predict and explore a user's experience. While keeping the problem in mind, we also tried to walk in the shoes of these personas while creating a logical and understandable story.</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">Stage 5: Proposed Solution</h1>
                <p>Putting together personas and storyboards shed light on what users could want concerning smartphone usage for us. By creating representations of goals and frustrations, we discussed some ideas for a mobile app, but one stood out to us: a step by step program. </p>
            
                <p>Our proposed solution is loosely based on the well-known 12-step program for recovering from alcohol addiction. This program has been used in several recovery programs aside from alcohol and has been proven to be a reliable means of breaking the overpowering force of addiction. The program begins with awareness of the problem, and then moves on to challenge and enable the addict to become disciplined, so that eventually there is no need to be in the program anymore. We have this same vision for our solution -- to create a ‘program’ (app) which allows users to learn and practice discipline over their smartphone usage at their own pace - a personalized journey to improvement. Our initial obstacle is in convincing people that they have a problem which needs to be fixed in the first place. Most smartphone users are either unaware of how much they use their devices, or are in denial, or are aware of the problem but are ‘fine’ with it. In order to get past these attitudes, we need a creative approach which stems from an understanding of emotions and motivations.</p>

                <p>This solution will be a self-paced process with gamified concepts intertwined. During the onboarding experience, the user will be asked to complete a survey. This survey will be used to gauge the individual’s awareness of their smartphone usage as well as how interested they are in tackling the issue. Based on the survey analysis, one of 3 potential paths will be recommended. Though we will recommend the one that we feel would work best for the user, they can choose whichever they prefer to follow.</p>

                <p>The 3 paths will be 1) Passive, 2) Active, and 3) Proactive. The Passive app is for individuals that are the least interested in gaining control of their smartphone usage, though they are willing to take steps but not many. The Active path is for users that are interested in gaining control of their smartphone usage, specifically due to their own awareness of the issue. The Proactive path will be for users that are both aware of their usage and more than ready to begin decreasing in.These three paths do not necessarily correlate to levels of difficulty. They are more tailored for the difference levels of complexity that arise with each level of excessive smartphone usage.</p>
                
                <p>All paths will have a set number of steps, though the amount and complexity of tasks needed to complete each step will vary based on the path. Each step will be formulaic in the experience that it’ll provide the user. It’ll begin by providing encouragement and empowerment, continue with a system of accountability, and finish by giving the user a reward.</p>
            
                <p>At the end of the process the user will be using their smartphone with more intention and purpose, thus decreasing and hopefully putting an end to the excessive use. </p>
            
                <h1 class="section-title">Stage 6: Lo-Fi Prototyping</h1>
                
                <h2 class="center">Idea 1: Evaluation Test</h2>
                
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/evaluationtest01.jpg">
            
                <p>After the user first downloads the app, there will be an evaluation test done to define what kind of relationship the user wants with his or her phone. Some questions asked will be: What things do you do on your phone that make you feel good? What activities make you feel bad? What phone behaviors or habits would you like to change? By the end of the questionnaire, the app will present one suggested route out of three routes: passive, active, or proactive. It should be noted that the user does not have to follow the evaluation’s suggested answer and can choose a different path. The questions help us determine at what stages of tackling addiction - will the user need more help?</p>
            
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/evaluationtest02.png">
                    
                <p>For instance, from our survey, we realized how some users, in spite of explicitly stating that their usage affects their sleep cycle and makes them anxious, somehow did not choose overall that the phone affects their health. Tying sleep deprivation and anxiety explicitly to a user’s overall well being is part of our awareness module, and that user for instance, will go through more stages in that module, in order for them to make a sound decision about their usage. Similarly, different stages will omit out or be added, based on what we determine as a user’s general profile cohort.</p>
            
                <h2 class="center">Idea 2: Step-by-Step Process</h2>
                
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/stepbystep01.png">
                
                <p>The main utility of our application lies in our ability to create a customized track for users to be more satisfied with their smartphone usage at their own pace. The step-by-step course is determined after the user takes the evaluation test, and chooses a track that aligns well with their incentives and needs, as mentioned in the previous section. The course will be divided into multiple phases, and each phase will have a set of chronological tasks that the user has to go through in order to advance further. These steps will be short and simple for the user to execute. Ideally they should be done when the user is relaxed. Before starting the journey, we’ll ask the user about how much time are they interested in committing to this per day. Accordingly, we’ll remind the user every day about what has to be done to move forward, and design the interface to show little forms of reward when the meet their daily goal. After the time is set, the user traverses through the steps that are specific to achieving the phase’s goal.</p>
            
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/stepbystep02.jpg">
            
                <p>For instance, we’d first start with a phase whether the user is educated holistically about the disadvantages of smartphone usage. Between every educational piece of content, the user will also be prompted to quizzes about the content, in order to not only make sure that the user is paying attention, but also to actively engage the user in the process. The second phase would help the user realize out of all the negative effects, what are some areas, the user is being affected specifically from the usage. In this phase, content will be very specific to digging deeper into the effects of smartphone usage specific to the user’s life. In these steps, we’d also include actions such as making the user log his ambitions and goals, and what he feels when he can’t achieve them due to his addiction. The next phase would focus on then building an action plan for tackling the issue, partly through the steps other famous people have taken, and partly through what the user feels is ‘the right track for me.’ And throughout all these phases, the user can challenge his friends that might need this application equally as much, and can also choose to sync each of their progress reports, in order to stay competitive and nudge the other person when they don’t meet their daily target.</p>
            
                <h2 class="center">Idea 3: Manual Actions</h2>
            
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/manualactions01.jpg">
            
                <p>Apart from the regulated step-by-step course, from time to time, the user can focus on self-mandating his usage by choosing to go ‘off the grid’ when needed, and also logging his personal targets of what level of activity he wishes to spend on his apps, and whether any of his activities need more reflection and work. While doing work, sometimes we choose to have our notifications because we don’t want to miss out on important work related communication. The importance of that message might vary, but regardless once the flow is interrupted, it’s hard to get back on. Off the grid is like “do not disturb”. It not only blocks notifications apart from a list of custom priority calls or messages, but it also notifies the person trying to contact you that you are off the grid. The person can choose to notify you anyway, but it had better be important. This provides a way for the user to input their own personal evaluation. With a variety of interactive exercises, the user can take the correct steps to understand himself/herself.</p>
            
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/manualactions02.jpg">
                
                <p>Depending on how the process is going for the user, he/she may need an extra boost of encouragement or some extra help. To cater to these needs, we will have special alert buttons which provide the help and response that someone needs in the moment. For instance, the user could push an emergency button titled ‘I’m craving’ which alerts the app to the state of the user. The app can then provide short notes of encouragement and remind the user to count to ten slowly until the craving passes. The app may also adjust the path the user is on to either rewind and review past content, or spend more time on another module, etc. Having a button which can be pressed in a time of panic is very useful for allowing the user to feel affirmed and to get the help he/she needs. We may also incorporate a ‘hotline’ where the user can speak to an accountability partner or a personal coach. For both of these options - the craving button or hotline - the user needs to take personal initiative and press the button. The key is making it as accessible and welcoming as possible. The user should know that he/she can get better and be able to get the encouragement they need. The craving button or hotline will change the course for the user (which is why this idea is under manual actions), but ultimately it will allow the app to be ‘in the know’ and be better suited to the user.</p>
            
                <h2 class="center">Idea 4: Challenge Yourself</h2>
                
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/challengeyourself01.jpg">
                
                <p>After determining the intent and need for curbing excessive smartphone usage of a specific user through the evaluation test, we then navigate the users through a series of increasingly difficult set of challenges that help the user realize how dependent they are on their phone, and subsequently how better they feel once they are in control of their sanity with only the phone’s limited, productive use case. While we haven’t necessarily come up with these yet, the challenges could have fun titles (more positive-sounding ones) and graphics to make it seem more game-like and appealing. These challenges include but are not limited to: 
                </p>
            
                <p><b>Grayscale:</b> Grayscale your phone for specified time.<br>
                <b>Disconnect:</b> Delete social media apps altogether, or restrict usage only to a certain time period.<br>
                <b>Best Time:</b> Amount of time you've not touched the phone at all.</p>
            
                <h2 class="center">Idea 5: Phone Usage Tracker</h2>
                
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/phoneusagetracker01.jpg">
            
                <p>Like how a FitBit counts steps or how a fitness app counts calories digested per day, one feature of the app will count how many minutes or hours that a user uses his/her phone per day. Based on the evaluation test, the phone usage can show if a user is using his/her phone more than intended and how much time is spent on certain apps. On the other hand, similar to achieving a certain distance on a running fitness app, encouraging and rewarding messages on the homescreen will pop up after turning on a phone or not using a phone after a long time.</p>
