                <h1 class="section-title">Background</h1>
                
                <p>For my <a href="http://www.sunyoungkim.org/class/hci_sp18" target="_blank">Human-Computer Interaction</a> class, we had a whole semester to work on a group project that focused on the theme of a <b>smartphone application for health, wellness, and/or environmental sustainability</b>. After a lot of ideas, we decided to do something that we all related to - using our smartphones excessively. All in all, this course teaches us how to design technologies that are effective for humans to use by learning about fundamental Human-Computer Interaction theories and design principles .</p>
            
                <h1 class="section-title">The Problem</h1>
            
                <p>Before thinking of any ideas, we started with thinking about a problem to tackle and came up with something that was widely present in our lives as college students: excessive smartphone usage. We saw that excessive phone usage hurts productivity and mental stability, but there is a lack of awareness about the problem's severity. Although it may seem ironic to have a smartphone application to fight excessive smartphone usage, we realized that an important factor to combat the issue is that individuals need to go at their own pace. They need an approach that suits their needs & desires to solve it, but current tools follow a "one size fits all" premise.</p>
 
                <h1 class="section-title">Data Collection </h1>
            
                <h2 class="center">Interview Script</h2>
            
                <p>In this stage, we were to collect data from users so that we could understand user experience and information needs. </p>
            
                <p>To gather data, we did four semi-structured interviews. We started with set topics for discussion and followed up based on the answers. We made sure to formulate our questions to encourage rich, open-ended answers. Our interviewees were all fourth-year undergraduates: three males named James, Tazz, Roger, and one female named Micaela.</p>
            
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                        <p class="quote"><i>"[My phone usage] seemed like it's excessive, but then when I step back and [..] see how many people are on their phone, [...] I think that they probably use their smartphones just as much as me if not more. So no, I don't personally think I use my smartphone excessively because everyone else probably uses it the same amount as I do."</i> - James</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <p>At first, <b>James</b> felt that he did spend too much time on his phone because he liked to use it to kill time. He is aware that it does kill his productivity at times because he's distracted when he's texting his friends, and he admitted that sometimes he stays awake much later than planned since he gets carried away with his phone at night. On the contrary, if he notices that he is getting distracted, James is able to take the initative to step back from the phone and log out of his social media accounts to stop getting notifiactions. As we progressed through the interview and took a closer look at a phone's place in society, he came to the conclusion that he didn't feel like he was actually using his phone excessively. After all, he feels entertained and it makes him happy by watching YouTube videos and keeping up with friends.</p>

                        <p><b>Micaela</b> is a girl who is well aware of how often she uses her phone and is actively trying to stay less attached. She sees her phone as a distraction for productivity, but she mostly has an issue with how attached people can become to their phones in a negative way towards mental health. For instance, she sets her phone so that she does not recieve any notifications for certains apps such as Facebook or Instagram. Her core reasoning was because she felt that the amount of notifications she recieved affected her self-esteem; if she posts a photo and there is a lack of notification of how many likes she gets, it gets to her. Moreover, she checks her phone multiple times throughout the day because she does not like the thought of possibly missing something important. Ultimately, Micaela believes that a phone is a great tool, but sometimes there can be a negative impact on one's perception of themself and others.

                        <p><b>Tazz</b> already considered himself to be an excessive smartphone user at the beginning of the interview. Tazz relies on his phone heavily for communication and social media, but also finds his phone useful for academic purposes such as with apps like Chegg or to ask others about homework. He mentions that seeing social media heavily affects his image of people and feels that he even gained weight from being addicted to watching too many videos which restrains him from physical activity. Tazz is aware of the negative implications that come with using his smartphone, but he concludes that he sees his usage as a problem but does not know what a solution could be; after all, he could be continue these activities with a laptop. His smartphone usage is a problem worth looking into, but he has little interest in changing his habits.</p>

                <p>After our interviews, we transferred the raw data to sticky notes so that we could create an affinity diagram. To make sense of the interviews, we color-coordinated each interviewee and their thoughts. From there, we synthesized the notes by categorizing them into clusters that made sense to us.

                <h3 class="center">What We Learned</h3>
                <p>Our interviews were very rich and in-depth which allowed us to explore motivations for smartphone usage beyond what appears on the surface. It was interesting to see how each of our interviewees were all somehow aware of excessive smartphone usage, but had different attitudes about it. One has taken many steps to hinder excessive smartphone usage; another just accepts it, sees it as the way things are, and doesn’t care; another is disciplined about his usage and is able to detach from his phone fairly easily; while yet another seems to focus more on the positives that he gets out of it, thus justifying his excessive usage. It was good and informative for us to see four different perspectives and to hear the many different answers to each of the questions. </p>
            
                <p>One big thing that we can draw from our interviews is the conclusion that students do use their smartphones excessively, and that smartphones act as distractions from being productive. The students also communicate a general sense of excessive smartphone usage negatively impacting their lives in areas such as mental or physical health, productivity level, or social pressure. We have noted that their constant reliance and apparent ‘need’ or preference for their smartphones ultimately shows signs of addiction (thus why we made this a super category with several sub-categories included within).</p>
            
                <p>Another super category that we formulated is Awareness of Use. Our interviewees displayed and shared about their different levels of self-awareness, awareness of others’ use, others’ awareness of their use, and a sense of justification or acceptance of their use. All of these things point to how students see and experience the phenomenon of excessive smartphone usage in their own lives and the world around them. Understanding our interviewees and their own awareness (how they see and react to the world) helps us step inside their shoes and look at the situation from a user perspective. Other categories such as current restrictions they use, or what they think would help them use their smartphones less excessively point to some potential solutions.</p>
            
                <p>Without delving in too deeply, we have found it interesting to observe the underlying motivations and ‘root issues’ responsible for this addiction. In reviewing our interviewees’ answers and expressions, we observe fears of loneliness or appearing ‘uncool’, a need to escape boredom or emptiness, apathy and mindless distraction, a desire for connection and relationships, and comparison combined with pressure to upkeep an ‘image’ of the self through social media. While there are, of course, positives to smartphones and how we use them, we observe many negatives which could be addressed. We would like to further explore these observations and see if we can formulate unique and creative solutions which are based on root causes, thus attacking the problem from the inside out.</p>

While most feel that their productivity is affected, less than one-third respondents feel that their health is affected. What is interesting though, is that of all respondents who didn’t consider that their health was negatively affected, at least two-thirds have faced some sort of depression because of their usage habits and usually find themselves being anxious because of catering to notifications. Moreover, a strong 80% of respondents feel that their sleeping cycle is disturbed because of using their smartphone. As for distraction, more than half of the respondents find their phone most distracting in a public work setting like lecture halls and meetings.</p>

                       <p>While one-third of the respondents purposefully leave their smartphones at home sometimes just to feel disconnected, one-third of the respondents also mentioned approaching this issue with brute force and developing self control of turning off the phone or keeping it inaccessible when working. Almost 20% of the respondents also mentioned using apps that restrict usage by time and block apps that are not productive.</p>

                <h3 class="center">What We Learned</h3>
                <p>When we compared the number of daily hours spent by a satisfied smartphone user with that of an unsatisfied one, the average usage is almost the same. This helps us understand that the amount of hours spent does not relate to whether you will be unsatisfied, but rather what you spend it on and how you look at excessive usage. In further comments, several respondents presented strong feelings about how smartphone addiction is growing and is harming them and society more than its helping, however, very few have actually looked into solving this problem systematically through a process or seeking aid from a friend or an app. In spite of admitting how it negatively affects their productivity, health and relationships, people seem to just have accepted that they’ll have to live with it, because not having a smartphone in this day and age, isn’t an option.</p>

                <h2 class="center">Personas</h2>
            
                <p>To better understand our potential users, we created personas so that we could get a precise description of a hypothetical user. For example, we could think about what they suffer from and wish to do when using a smartphone. Based on the problem, our own thinking, and inspired by survey results, we came up with Jessica and Michael.</p>
            
                 <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">

                <p>Based on these personas, we created storyboards with these two personas so that we could visually predict and explore a user's experience. While keeping the problem in mind, we also tried to walk in the shoes of these personas while creating a logical and understandable story.</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">Proposed Solution</h1>
                <p>Putting together personas and storyboards shed light on what users could want concerning smartphone usage for us. By creating representations of goals and frustrations, we discussed some ideas for a mobile app, but one stood out to us: a step by step program. </p>
            
                <p>Our proposed solution is loosely based on the well-known 12-step program for recovering from alcohol addiction. This program has been used in several recovery programs aside from alcohol and has been proven to be a reliable means of breaking the overpowering force of addiction. The program begins with awareness of the problem, and then moves on to challenge and enable the addict to become disciplined, so that eventually there is no need to be in the program anymore. We have this same vision for our solution -- to create a ‘program’ (app) which allows users to learn and practice discipline over their smartphone usage at their own pace - a personalized journey to improvement. Our initial obstacle is in convincing people that they have a problem which needs to be fixed in the first place. Most smartphone users are either unaware of how much they use their devices, or are in denial, or are aware of the problem but are ‘fine’ with it. In order to get past these attitudes, we need a creative approach which stems from an understanding of emotions and motivations.</p>

                <p>This solution will be a self-paced process with gamified concepts intertwined. During the onboarding experience, the user will be asked to complete a survey. This survey will be used to gauge the individual’s awareness of their smartphone usage as well as how interested they are in tackling the issue. Based on the survey analysis, one of 3 potential paths will be recommended. Though we will recommend the one that we feel would work best for the user, they can choose whichever they prefer to follow.</p>

                <p>The 3 paths will be 1) Passive, 2) Active, and 3) Proactive. The Passive app is for individuals that are the least interested in gaining control of their smartphone usage, though they are willing to take steps but not many. The Active path is for users that are interested in gaining control of their smartphone usage, specifically due to their own awareness of the issue. The Proactive path will be for users that are both aware of their usage and more than ready to begin decreasing in.These three paths do not necessarily correlate to levels of difficulty. They are more tailored for the difference levels of complexity that arise with each level of excessive smartphone usage.</p>
                
                <p>All paths will have a set number of steps, though the amount and complexity of tasks needed to complete each step will vary based on the path. Each step will be formulaic in the experience that it’ll provide the user. It’ll begin by providing encouragement and empowerment, continue with a system of accountability, and finish by giving the user a reward.</p>
            
                <p>At the end of the process the user will be using their smartphone with more intention and purpose, thus decreasing and hopefully putting an end to the excessive use. </p>

                <h2 class="center">Idea 1: Evaluation Test</h2>
                
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/evaluationtest01.jpg">
            
                <p>After the user first downloads the app, there will be an evaluation test done to define what kind of relationship the user wants with his or her phone. Some questions asked will be: What things do you do on your phone that make you feel good? What activities make you feel bad? What phone behaviors or habits would you like to change? By the end of the questionnaire, the app will present one suggested route out of three routes: passive, active, or proactive. It should be noted that the user does not have to follow the evaluation’s suggested answer and can choose a different path. The questions help us determine at what stages of tackling addiction - will the user need more help?</p>
            
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/evaluationtest02.png">
                    
                <p>For instance, from our survey, we realized how some users, in spite of explicitly stating that their usage affects their sleep cycle and makes them anxious, somehow did not choose overall that the phone affects their health. Tying sleep deprivation and anxiety explicitly to a user’s overall well being is part of our awareness module, and that user for instance, will go through more stages in that module, in order for them to make a sound decision about their usage. Similarly, different stages will omit out or be added, based on what we determine as a user’s general profile cohort.</p>
            
                <h2 class="center">Idea 2: Step-by-Step Process</h2>
                
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/stepbystep01.png">
                
                <p>The main utility of our application lies in our ability to create a customized track for users to be more satisfied with their smartphone usage at their own pace. The step-by-step course is determined after the user takes the evaluation test, and chooses a track that aligns well with their incentives and needs, as mentioned in the previous section. The course will be divided into multiple phases, and each phase will have a set of chronological tasks that the user has to go through in order to advance further. These steps will be short and simple for the user to execute. Ideally they should be done when the user is relaxed. Before starting the journey, we’ll ask the user about how much time are they interested in committing to this per day. Accordingly, we’ll remind the user every day about what has to be done to move forward, and design the interface to show little forms of reward when the meet their daily goal. After the time is set, the user traverses through the steps that are specific to achieving the phase’s goal.</p>
            
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/stepbystep02.jpg">
            
                <p>For instance, we’d first start with a phase whether the user is educated holistically about the disadvantages of smartphone usage. Between every educational piece of content, the user will also be prompted to quizzes about the content, in order to not only make sure that the user is paying attention, but also to actively engage the user in the process. The second phase would help the user realize out of all the negative effects, what are some areas, the user is being affected specifically from the usage. In this phase, content will be very specific to digging deeper into the effects of smartphone usage specific to the user’s life. In these steps, we’d also include actions such as making the user log his ambitions and goals, and what he feels when he can’t achieve them due to his addiction. The next phase would focus on then building an action plan for tackling the issue, partly through the steps other famous people have taken, and partly through what the user feels is ‘the right track for me.’ And throughout all these phases, the user can challenge his friends that might need this application equally as much, and can also choose to sync each of their progress reports, in order to stay competitive and nudge the other person when they don’t meet their daily target.</p>
            
                <h2 class="center">Idea 3: Manual Actions</h2>
            
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/manualactions01.jpg">
            
                <p>Apart from the regulated step-by-step course, from time to time, the user can focus on self-mandating his usage by choosing to go ‘off the grid’ when needed, and also logging his personal targets of what level of activity he wishes to spend on his apps, and whether any of his activities need more reflection and work. While doing work, sometimes we choose to have our notifications because we don’t want to miss out on important work related communication. The importance of that message might vary, but regardless once the flow is interrupted, it’s hard to get back on. Off the grid is like “do not disturb”. It not only blocks notifications apart from a list of custom priority calls or messages, but it also notifies the person trying to contact you that you are off the grid. The person can choose to notify you anyway, but it had better be important. This provides a way for the user to input their own personal evaluation. With a variety of interactive exercises, the user can take the correct steps to understand himself/herself.</p>
            
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/manualactions02.jpg">
                
                <p>Depending on how the process is going for the user, he/she may need an extra boost of encouragement or some extra help. To cater to these needs, we will have special alert buttons which provide the help and response that someone needs in the moment. For instance, the user could push an emergency button titled ‘I’m craving’ which alerts the app to the state of the user. The app can then provide short notes of encouragement and remind the user to count to ten slowly until the craving passes. The app may also adjust the path the user is on to either rewind and review past content, or spend more time on another module, etc. Having a button which can be pressed in a time of panic is very useful for allowing the user to feel affirmed and to get the help he/she needs. We may also incorporate a ‘hotline’ where the user can speak to an accountability partner or a personal coach. For both of these options - the craving button or hotline - the user needs to take personal initiative and press the button. The key is making it as accessible and welcoming as possible. The user should know that he/she can get better and be able to get the encouragement they need. The craving button or hotline will change the course for the user (which is why this idea is under manual actions), but ultimately it will allow the app to be ‘in the know’ and be better suited to the user.</p>
            
                <h2 class="center">Idea 4: Challenge Yourself</h2>
                
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/challengeyourself01.jpg">
                
                <p>After determining the intent and need for curbing excessive smartphone usage of a specific user through the evaluation test, we then navigate the users through a series of increasingly difficult set of challenges that help the user realize how dependent they are on their phone, and subsequently how better they feel once they are in control of their sanity with only the phone’s limited, productive use case. While we haven’t necessarily come up with these yet, the challenges could have fun titles (more positive-sounding ones) and graphics to make it seem more game-like and appealing. These challenges include but are not limited to: 
                </p>
            
                <p><b>Grayscale:</b> Grayscale your phone for specified time.<br>
                <b>Disconnect:</b> Delete social media apps altogether, or restrict usage only to a certain time period.<br>
                <b>Best Time:</b> Amount of time you've not touched the phone at all.</p>
            
                <h2 class="center">Idea 5: Phone Usage Tracker</h2>
                
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/hciproject/phoneusagetracker01.jpg">
            
                <p>Like how a FitBit counts steps or how a fitness app counts calories digested per day, one feature of the app will count how many minutes or hours that a user uses his/her phone per day. Based on the evaluation test, the phone usage can show if a user is using his/her phone more than intended and how much time is spent on certain apps. On the other hand, similar to achieving a certain distance on a running fitness app, encouraging and rewarding messages on the homescreen will pop up after turning on a phone or not using a phone after a long time.</p>

                <h2 class="center">Critique Feedback</h2>
            
                <p>With peer review feedback, another group took a look at our project. The overall tone of our peers’ critique was positive and they had several good things to say about our app design. They were interested in the purpose and idea behind our app and considered our design and plan to be effective and engaging. However, the critique was also useful in pointing out ways we can improve, particularly the comments noting that some aspects of our navigation design are ambiguous. </p>
            
                <p>All in all, there are certain features that need to be implemented so that we could provide a much better user experience that is easier to follow and nicer to interact with. By adding an introduction that will explain what each section of the application is meant to do, as well as how to use the navigation bar, will provide guidance to the user that is currently missing. Separating the craving hotline from the ability to chat with a coach will allow us to both keep each functionality in its own place as well as reference to them independently throughout the application. Adding action buttons on specific screens for interaction (such as the ‘submit’ or ‘okay’ buttons in ‘Challenges’) is a functionality that is critical and we’re glad that it was caught in the wireframe stage. The addition of color and icons will definitely bring more life to the experience.</p>

                <p>Finally, we created our high fidelity prototype of <b>Release!</b> For this step, our design tool of choice is Figma. Although we worked with Sketch for wireframing, we chose Figma so that we could all collaborate on connecting with interactions and designs together remotely. Our logo is meant to resemble a chain breaking, except the chain link is a phone. This is to symbolize how the app can "release" someone from how chained they are to their unhealthy habits.</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">Heuristic Evaluation</h1>
            
                <p>After our high fidelity prototype was shown to the class, other groups were asked to fill out a hueristic evaluation survey of Release. </p>
            
                <h2 class="center">All Feedback</h2>
            
                <p>1. <b>Easy</b> to find project description? Easy (Avg: 4.28/5)<br>
2. <b>Visibility</b>: Are users kept informed about the primary action to take on each page? (Avg: 1.43/10)<br>
3. <b>Match between real world and system</b>: Is the language used at the interface appropriate for the user? (Avg: 0.57/10) <br>
4. <b>Consistency and Mapping</b>: are the ways of performing similar actions consistent? is mapping between user actions and performed tasks consistent and clear? (Avg: 1.57/10)<br>
5. <b>Recognition over recall</b>: are objects, actions and options always visible? (Avg: 1.29/10) <br>
6. <b>Ease of Input, Readability and Glancibility</b>: is info easy to enter; screens content easy to read and navigate? (Avg: 2.29/10) <br>
7. <b>Flexibility, Efficiency of use and Personalization</b>: is interaction efficient? is personalization supported? (Avg: 2.43/10) <br>
8. <b>Aesthetics and minimal design</b>: is any unnecessary and irrelevant information provided? (Avg: 0.57/10) <br> 
9. <b>Error prevention</b>: is it easy to make errors? is it easy to recognize that an error has been made? (Avg: 0.43/10) <br> 
10. How useful was a <b>product description</b>? (Avg: 4.14/5)</p>
            
            <p>Overall, in our 7 evaluations, none of the areas of evaluation on average were reported higher than 2.5/10 on a scale of severity of the problem. Some issues that were raised about our app were how wordy the app was and that there is less room for personalization, apart from choosing routes, which are also not explained clearly. However, the 2.5/10 scale implies that apart from a couple specific critical issues, our users found our hi-fi prototype convenient to use, and many complimented our aesthetics. We could use improvement, however, in making the application more readable, glanceable and flexible based on the user’s expectations.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title">Final Outcome</h1>
            <p>For our final presentation, we were required to create a video about our application. Using Adobe Premiere Pro, we created this:</p>
            
            <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lSq7bIiPpLM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
            
           <p>Based on peer feedback, professor feedback, and teaching assistant feedback, we recieved an A on our project! Some comments from our peers included that the application is well thought out, useful, and well designed. On the other hand, some critiqued that it may be difficult to attract users to use this app in the first place. In addition, our professor and TA said that we had a very well-made video, prototype, and logo. </p>
            
            <p>This project and class certainly falls as my one of my best experiences during my whole undergraduate careeer. I truly enjoyed the class and was so passionate about this project that it ended up influencing my desired career choice. Before this class, I never knew user experience design existed. I learned an incredible amount, from how important relentless design iteration is, teamwork, and how to do user research. I hope to take these skills and steps to creating more projects!</p>
