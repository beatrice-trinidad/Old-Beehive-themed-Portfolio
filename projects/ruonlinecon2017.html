                <h1 class="section-title">Rutgers Online Learning Conference 2017</h1>
            
                <h2 class="projectdesc">In 2017, I was hired to work as an assistant program manager to organize an e-learning conference hosted by the Center of Online & Hybrid Learning and Instructional Technology (COHLIT) department at Rutgers University. I was involved with all aspects of organizing this conference, from ensuring a high-quality program, communications, and especially graphic, web & brand design for a conference that gathered hundreds of attendees.</h2>

                <div class="button">
                <i class="fas fa-mouse-pointer"></i> See it for yourself</div></a>
                </div>
                
                
                <p><b>Timeline:</b> 3 months (January 2017 - March 2017)</p>
                
                <p><b>Client:</b> Rutgers University: Teaching and Learning with Technology (TLT) - formerly known as Center for Online & Hybrid Learning and Instructional Technologies (COHLIT), Division of Continuing Studies</p>
                
                <p><b>Role:</b> Assistant Program Manager in which I oversaw and coordinated almost all aspects of the event, from communication, planning, marketing, and web development</p>
            
                <p><b>Tools:</b> Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Drupal</p>
            
                <h1 class="section-title">Experience</h1>
                <p>I was assigned to work under the Senior Program Manager and help her with basically everything that went into organizing and running the conference. This was a really exciting opportunity to me because this was the first time I was able to dabble in a variety of aspects rather than sticking to one field. Prior to this experience, I had was solely assigned to work on graphic design or solely assigned to work in planning, so it was really cool to be able to be responsible for a lot of things at once.
                
                <p> I was heavily in charge with not only communicating to the Senior Program Manager, but also communicating with other stakeholders, participants, and organizers of the event. The most fun part for me was being able to work with the website. Because I have prior webmaster experience, they allowed to me work on the website‚Äôs Drupal platform to update the website and other social media platforms with pertinent information. This was my first experience with Drupal which was a challenge since I felt like it had a higher learning curve than my previous experience in WordPress.</p>

                <p>Even more so, I assisted in planning and administrative work; some responsibilities include working on scheduling, communicating with sponsors, and meeting with venue coordinators. On the day-of, I ran around and did whatever needed to be done with the rest of the student workers and to our delight, the conference was a success with hundreds of attendees!</p>
            
           
                <h1 class="section-title">Branding & Design</h1>
            
                <p>By far the highlight of my experience was also being in charge of marketing materials. Prior to my hire, there was no real "brand" to the conference. The website, booklet, and other print materials looked good in their own respect, but there was no unifying design that connected them all together. Accordingly, I decided to take on this challenge.</p>
                
                <p>For instance, here was the old booklet's design:</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                        <img class="center-img" src="/img/ruonlinecon2017/oldbooklet01.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                       <img class="center-img" src="/img/ruonlinecon2017/oldbooklet02.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                       <img class="center-img" src="/img/ruonlinecon2017/oldbooklet03.jpg">
                    </div>
                </div>
                
            
                <p>That year, the conference's theme was <i>REIMAGINE</i>, and the department had already created this banner that would highlight the conference's theme. </p>
            
                <img class="center-img" src="/img/ruonlinecon2017/reimaginebanner.jpg">
                
                <p>I really took inspiration from this and the  <a href="http://ruonlinecon.rutgers.edu" target="blank">
                website's</a>  red, black, and white color scheme. After all, it did follow the traditional colors of Rutgers. In addition, I wanted to establish the network image logo as a symbol of this conference. From there, I was able to create an idea for where I could take the conference's branding.</p>

                <p>Working for an event is stressful, yet exciting. You know the exact date it will happen, but until everyone leaves the venue, the stress is never over. However, it was worth it!</p>

                <p>Although I am not working for the conference anymore, I am proud to say that the conference has still continued to implement my branding and designs. It makes me happy to see how well they have implemented my ideas from 2017, but made slight improvements to make them even better.<p>
