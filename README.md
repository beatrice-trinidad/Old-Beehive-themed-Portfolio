BEA-HIVE: Personal Website Portfolio
---
Simple bee-themed portfolio put together. Forever changing and the code is not perfect, but I'm getting there.

Cool Stuff
---
- No front-end framework used! I could have used a template or made a portfolio on SquareSpace, but I really wanted to take on the challenge of making a responsie and clean design with plain HTML and CSS.
- Purely SVG-made honeycomb banner


Notable Updates
---
**12/19/2017:** Initial upload! Finally got something that is somewhat presentable.

**2/15/2017:** After quite some time and other things going on in my life, I finally finished the general look and branding of my website. I literally went through different shades of yellow about a thousand times, and the font maybe a hundred times. I also transferred this project to GitHub Pages.
